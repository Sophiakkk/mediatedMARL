# mediatedMARL
This repository accompanies our paper "Mediated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" published at AAMAS, 2023.

This is the code we used for our experiments in one of the earlier revisions of the paper. It is not good. We tried to make a more general codebase but it ended up taking too much time. We're releasing this because it's better than nothing.

The minimial working example is in a single notebook in the `pgg` folder, but note that it has some ad-hoc solutions for the sake of simplicity. If you want to apply mediators to your environment, the most general version of the code is in `pgg-iter`.
